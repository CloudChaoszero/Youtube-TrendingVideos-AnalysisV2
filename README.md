## Introduction

![Youtube Views](Resources/Images/youtube.jpg)

This is a redux of my [Youtube Analysis project](https://github.com/CloudChaoszero/Youtube-TrendsNMore) back in January 2018. 

I utilizied Kaggle user Mitchell J's, [Trending Youtube Video dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new) to answer the following questions:

* What are the top 10 trending

1. Youtube videos

2. Categories

3. Youtube Channels

based on user view counts

Now, I would like to both answer the above questions, and so much more by emulating that past project. This emulation is done through development of some additional analysis, creating a streamline ETL process, app, and so much more.

Enjoy!
